## Project Overview

Synch is an end-to-end encrypted Obsidian Sync alternative. The repository is a pnpm workspace with:

- `apps/api`: Cloudflare Workers API, Hono, Drizzle, Better Auth.
- `apps/obsidian-plugin`: Obsidian plugin client.
- `apps/www`: Astro website.
- `packages/*`: shared workspace packages.

Prioritize preserving end-to-end encryption guarantees, vault safety, and compatibility with Obsidian plugin behavior.

## Engineering Approach

Favor long-term maintainability over quick patches. Do not paper over symptoms with narrow, brittle fixes when the surrounding design needs adjustment.

- Understand the relevant module boundaries, data flow, and existing abstractions before changing code.
- Prefer cohesive fixes that address the underlying cause while preserving the current architecture and user-facing behavior.
- Keep changes scoped, but make the scope large enough to avoid duplicating logic, bypassing invariants, or adding special cases that future work will have to unwind.
- When a short-term workaround is unavoidable, document the reason, the tradeoff, and the follow-up needed to remove it.

## Debugging the Sync Engine

`docs/failure-patterns.md` records what has actually broken, the shapes that
recur, and the measurements that find them. Read it before changing the sync
engine, and add to it when a bug turns out to be an instance of something
rather than a one-off.

Its first rule is the important one: **diagnose by measuring, not by reasoning
about the code.** Before proposing a cause, produce a number that only that
cause explains. Every confident theory in this project's history that was not
backed by a measurement turned out to be wrong.

## User-Facing Copy

All user-visible text - website, auth pages, plugin notices, error messages,
release notes - follows `docs/copy-style.md`. Error messages in particular must
name what happened, what it means, and what the reader should do about it.

Syncali is a fork of [Synch](https://github.com/hjinco/synch) (MIT). Attribution
belongs anywhere the project is described.

## Package Manager

Use `pnpm`. Do not use `npm` or `yarn`.
